        I think we had tried to use EventSetter before to call gaze-clickable function, but we were unsuccessful. I think this is
        because we had been using tobii:Behaviors.HasGaze (A boolean) rather than tobii:Behaviors.HasGazeChanged. I believe we recognized this
        but were unsure how to proceed because we weren't sure what the events available to us were as we were too unfamiliar with the eye tracker's documentation.
    
        It's also difficult because they use .HasGaze in the example .cs code in the github repository referenced in MainWindow.xaml.cs (https://github.com/Tobii/interaction-samples)
        This property didn't translate over to the newer SDK it seems because I tried implementing it and could not get it to work. Let me know if you guys have any questions.
